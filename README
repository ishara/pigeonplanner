-= What is it? =-

Pigeon Planner aims to be a simple to use pigeon database.
Organise and manage your pigeons by adding, editing, removing
them in a list.
View their details, including, but not limited to, band number,
name, colour, picture, etc.
You can select to view the pedigree, relatives or results
per pigeon. Check a detailed pedigree with extra information
and a generation further or print the pedigree. See brothers
and sisters, halfbrothers and sisters and offspring.
View/add results for each one. With the detailed results window,
it is possible to see all results of all pigeons and sort them
according to some parameters.
