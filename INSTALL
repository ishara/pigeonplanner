-= Install Pigeon Planner =-

See your platform below for instructions.

*Linux:
Untar the package, go into the bin/ directory and run pigeonplanner to
start Pigeon Planner and pigeonplanner-db for the database tool. The program
doesn't need to be installed, so it can be run as is. If you want to install
it anyway, run the following command in the source directory:
sudo python setup.py install

*Windows
Run the setup file and install the program. Start Pigeon Planner by
the shortcut in the startmenu or on the desktop (optional).


Linux distribution packages will be added in the future if necessary.
